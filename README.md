# 01-Introduction

I wrote this code to descibe my thoughts going into this course and give a little background about myself. I used the program to also help myself complete a school project for my game technology class. I have high hopes for the rest of the semester being a lot more smooth than this. I hope to learn a lot!

I don't know how to do many "interesting features" so I'm sorry.
